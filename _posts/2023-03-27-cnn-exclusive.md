As part of its commitment to celebrating the enterprising creative labor involved in book publishing, the National Book Development Board (NBDB) and the Manila Critics Circle (MCC) announce the finalists of the 40th National Book Awards.

An annual prize that honors the most prestigious book titles written, designed, and published in the Philippines, the National Book Awards is crucial in a craft that is as significant as it is undersupported. Books and the people who make them are at the frontlines of our fight against disinformation and historical distortion â€” the National Book Awards reinvigorates Philippine publishing, spotlighting local voices and attracting a wider readership.
