excerpt: "Excited to share our new paper on the successful genome assembly of an <i>aquatic</i> fungus (emphasis on aquatic) isolated from a freshwater habitat! Our DNA analyses show it clusters with <i>Leptobacillium coffeanum</i> but forms a distinct lineage—pointing to the discovery of a potential <i>new</i> species of fungi. This was a fun and personal team-up with folks from UP Visayas and the Philippine Genome Center Visayas."

<b>Abstract:</b> <i>Leptobacillium</i>, a lignicolous hyphomycetous fungus composed of 11 known species, is recognized for its potential as a source of biocontrol agents and bioactive compounds. In this study, we report the draft genome of <i>Leptobacillium coffeanum</i>, a species previously isolated in Brazil and now recorded in the Philippines. This genomic resource provides a foundation for future investigations into its ecological roles, metabolic capabilities, and potential applications in agriculture and biotechnology.<br>
