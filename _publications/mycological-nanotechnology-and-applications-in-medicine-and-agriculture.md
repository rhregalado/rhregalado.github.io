<b>Abstract:</b> Myconanotechnology is an interdisciplinary field that harnesses fungi for the green synthesis of nanomaterials with applications across medicine, agriculture, and environmental sustainability. Southeast Asia, a biodiversity hotspot, offers a rich repository of fungal species with the potential to serve as natural biofactories for nanoparticle production. This chapter provides a synthesis of current research on fungal-mediated nanoparticle synthesis in the region, focusing on mechanisms, biomedical applications, agricultural innovations, and industrial scalability. Fungal systems produce bioactive nanomaterials such as silver, gold, and zinc oxide nanoparticles through eco-friendly and cost-effective processes mediated by fungal enzymes, secretomes, and cellular structures. These nanomaterials have demonstrated potent antimicrobial, anticancer, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activities, with several studies across the region highlighting promising therapeutic effects. In agriculture, fungal-derived nanomaterials enhance crop protection, food preservation, and environmental remediation, offering sustainable alternatives to conventional agrochemicals and fertilizers. Despite these advancements, challenges such as strain variability, lack of standardization, regulatory gaps, and limited infrastructure hinder wider adoption and commercialization. Strengthening regional research collaborations, investment in biosafety infrastructure, and public-private partnerships are vital in unlocking the full potential of fungal nanotechnology in Southeast Asia.<br>
