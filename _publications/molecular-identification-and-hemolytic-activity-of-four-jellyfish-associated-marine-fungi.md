excerpt: "In the study, we preliminarily explored the potential of jellyfish-associated marine fungi for cytotoxicity indicators. Specifically, we investigated the presence of jellyfish-associated fungi and its presumptive cytotox potential for mouse erythrocyte hemolysis. Our findings showed promising results that these fungi could be a source of marine bioactive compounds for drug development. I'm happy to add that this paper is a product of my undergraduate thesis and is my very first scientific publication!"

<b>Abstract:</b> This study aims to preliminarily investigate and explore the potential of jellyfish-associated marine fungi in the
Philippines for cytotoxicity indicators. The fungi were isolated from the sub-umbrellar tissues of the jellyfish
Catostylus sp. collected from the coasts of Pio Duran in the Philippines. Fungal strains were molecular identified
using their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. Crude extracts were obtained by ethyl acetate (EtOAc)
extraction of rice-fermented culture supernatants. Qualitative preliminary metabolite screening on the crude
extracts and in vitro hemolysis screening of crude EtOAc extracts were conducted. Four fungal strains were
isolated which revealed 93% to 100% similarity to <i>Aspergillus nomius, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus
tamarii</i> and <i>Penicillium citrinum</i>. Alkaloids, phenols, and terpenoids were present in all the crude extracts.
Likewise, all crude fungal extracts demonstrated hemolytic activity in mouse erythrocytes with the highest
hemolytic activity (EC50 of 3.62Î¼g/ml) observed in Aspergillus tamarii crude extract. This result provided robust
baseline information that cnidarian-associated fungi species are promising sources of marine bioactive
compounds which could be later developed for novel drug candidates.<br>
