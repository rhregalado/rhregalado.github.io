excerpt: "During my short stint as a Science Research Assistant back in 2019, I had the privilege of co-authoring a monograph resulting from a research collaboration with the Department of Agriculture Region 5 and DOST-PAGASA. The report provides an in-depth account of our efforts to develop early warning systems aimed at bolstering local agricultural resilience in the Bicol River Basin area, with a particular focus on assisting marginalized agri-fishery communities in coping with the adverse impacts of climate change. Our report offers a shared stakeholders experience in climate and disaster-resilient development and contends that such development is essential in ameliorating extreme poverty and achieving shared climate consciousness. The report draws on selected case studies to showcase promising approaches, lessons learned, and remaining challenges, thereby providing valuable insights and recommendations to stakeholders invested in this agro-watershed area."

<b>Abstract:</b> In the Philippines, the Bicol Region is one of the most disaster-prone areas due to its physiographic and topographic characteristics. Although the effects of climate change are expected to vary geographically, the natural hazards experienced in the region, mainly storms and largescale flooding, poses a significant risk to marginalized households and predominantly on the spatial and temporal aspects of agricultural productivity. Considering the vast area covered by the Bicol River Basin area, one of the country's productive regions, a significant sum of pesos (Php) in agri-fishery damages is experienced perennially by the communities living within the area. Thus, developing early warning systems accessible to the farmers and fisherfolks may help mitigate the debilitating impacts of the erratic climate variability and extremes. This report presents a shared stakeholders' experience in climate and disaster-resilient development and aims to contribute to the importance of local agricultural resiliency. With this, selected case studies were used throughout the report to illustrate promising approaches, lessons learned, and remaining challenges.<br>

<strong>FUN FACT:</strong>
  
The Bicol River Basin Project has been a recipient of several accolades and critical acclaim from various esteemed award-giving bodies in the country. Shortly after its release in 2021, it was awarded the <i>Outstanding Book/Monograph Award</i> by the National Academy of Science and Technology (NAST PHL) in 2022. And the following year, it was recognized as a Finalist for the Best Book in Science at the 40th National Book Awards by the National Book Development Board (NBDB) and the Manila Critics Circle (MCC), earning a <i>Special Citation Award “…to recognize the scope of its contribution to Science”</i>. The significance of this monograph lies in its potential to revolutionize disaster preparedness and response strategies in the vulnerable agri-fishery communities of the BRB. The significance of this publication lies in its well-rounded content, which earned it its numerous prestigious accolades in the country. These recognitions have been instrumental in amplifying the voices of grassroot, marginalized Filipino climate survivors, especially during a time when people around the world are demanding for aggressive climate action. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="/features/">See more...</a></div><br><br>
