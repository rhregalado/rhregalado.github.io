excerpt: "This is the first of two chapters from a book I co-authored. In this chapter, we examine the critical roles of fungi in a changing planet, focusing on Southeast Asian soil fungi as an underexplored source of bioactive metabolites. We highlight key genera, recent compound discoveries, persistent research and methodological gaps, and the mounting environmental pressures threatening fungal biodiversity. Grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with experts from 11 countries on this comprehensive resource developed over two years."

<b>Abstract:</b> Soil fungi represent an immense, largely untapped source of bioactive secondary metabolites with significant pharmaceutical potential. In southeast Asia, where tropical climates, diverse ecosystems, and complex soil systems converge, fungal communities are particularly rich yet remain critically understudied. This chapter synthesizes current research on soil-derived fungi across the region, highlighting notable genera such as <i>Aspergillus, Penicillium, Trichoderma,</i> and <i>Ganoderma,</i> which have produced metabolites with antimicrobial, anticancer, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. Over 130 novel compounds have been identified in the past decade alone, predominantly in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. However, the pace of fungal discovery lags behind studies on bacteria, endophytes, and mycorrhizae, reflecting longstanding biases in microbial research. Methodological challenges include taxonomic complexity, culturing difficulty, and limited access to genomic and metabolomic tools. These limitations are further compounded by soil degradation, particularly in dominant soil types such as Acrisols and Ferralsols, which are low in fertility and prone to erosion, acidification, and nutrient depletion. Anthropogenic pressures—from deforestation and monoculture farming to peatland drainage—threaten fungal biodiversity across the region. Recognizing soil fungi as both vulnerable ecological assets and promising biomedical resources is key to transforming the region’s microbial wealth into sustainable health innovations.<br>
