excerpt: "In this book chapter, we discussed (con)current strategies addressing biosafety and biosecurity challenges posed by mycotoxins, commenting on their ramifications across socio-cultural, medical, agricultural, and legal domains within the broader Philippine context. Together with professionals in agriculture, medicine and allied fields, we revisit policies, standards, and practices currently in place to prevent any mycotoxin-related incidences among the population."

<b>Abstract:</b> The biosafety and biosecurity challenges associated with mushrooms and fungi in general, especially in low-resource countries such as the Philippines, remain a major concern in agriculture, medicine, and allied fields. In agriculture, mycotoxin post-harvest contamination causes significant losses in yield and a reduction in quality of products. In health, it poses risks to consumers, especially children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Further, the use of mushrooms for food and medicine in many parts of the country require thorough understanding so that they remain viable and sustainable, without compromising safety and security of consumers. Policies, standards, and practices currently in place prevent fungi-related injuries among the population.<br>
