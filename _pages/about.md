<p>Welcome to my personal academic space!</p>

<p>Kumusta! My name is Ric. I’m a first-gen, Filipino microbial ecologist and molecular biologist. I recently earned my Masters degree in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the <a href="https://nimbb.upd.edu.ph/" target="_blank">National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (NIMBB)</a> at the University of the Philippines Diliman (UP Diliman). During my time at NIMBB, I trained in the molecular toxicology group, where my work focused on the interplay of mining, metals, and microbes under the mentorship of <a href="https://nimbb.upd.edu.ph/?page_id=6327" target="_blank">Dr. Jay Lazaro</a>. You can learn more about our Lab <a href="#" onclick="openLightbox('/files/TOX.png'); return false;">here</a>.

<p>My research interests lie at the intersection of molecular biology and microbiology. I am particularly fascinated by life at its limits, especially microbial communities that persist even in the most extreme environments. I am deeply curious about understanding the fundamental principles that govern how microbes interact, adapt, and evolve in this specific niche. Using an integrated approach that combines computational analyses with laboratory experiments, I have investigated these processes in systems such as heavy metal-contaminated soils and hypersaline environments. During my recent Master’s work, I investigated the potential use of citric acid—a biodegradable and widely accessible food additive—as a leaching agent (lixiviant) to extract copper directly from mine tailings, and assessed how its amendment influence the activities of key microbial populations and their adaptive evolution over time. Through this work, I aim to contribute to sustainable metal extraction strategies and to support efficient land reuse solutions for legacy mining sites. More recently, I developed a special interest on the early evolution of life, with a focus on microorganisms adapted to the conditions of early Earth and what they reveal about the origins of life.</p>

<p>Outside the lab, you can often find me loitering around bookstores or museums, enjoying low-stimulation walks, running laps, or writing essays and columns in cafés for my blog. Lately, I’ve also been seeking out public spaces where groups exercise tai chi together.</p>

<p>I’ve curated this page to put together all the things that I wrote over the years as a <a style="color: steelblue" style="text-decoration:none">#ProudPinoy</a> scholar-researcher. I hope that by sharing this platform, it will encourage interest among readers from diverse backgrounds and serve as a valuable open-access resource to stimulate thought and discussion.</p>

<p>Glad you made it this far! Take a moment to explore the other tabs in the navigation bar; there’s plenty more to check out. If you want to see what I’ve been up to lately, you can catch my recent activities and engagements in the Activity Tab. I also try to maintain a blog where I share some of my more personal written works, you can check it <a href="https://rhregalado.github.io/essays/">here</a>. And if you found my content helpful and feel like supporting a sissy, feel free to buy me a coffee—I’d appreciate it. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
