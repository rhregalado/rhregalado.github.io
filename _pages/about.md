Welcome to my personal academic space!

Kumusta! My name is Ric. I recently earned my Masters degree in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the <a href="https://nimbb.upd.edu.ph/" target="_blank">National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (NIMBB)</a> at the University of the Philippines Diliman (UP Diliman). While at the NIMBB, I joined the molecular toxicology group led by  <a href="https://nimbb.upd.edu.ph/?page_id=6327" target="_blank">Assoc. Prof. Jose Enrico H. Lazaro, PhD</a> and worked on mining, metals, and microbes. You can learn more about our Lab <a href="#" onclick="openLightbox('/files/TOX.png'); return false;">here</a>.

My research interests lie at the intersection of molecular biology and microbiology, and presently engaged in studying microbe-metal interactions in heavy metal-polluted soils. I employ a combination of metagenomics, bioinformatics, computational and systems biology, as well as biogeochemistry to uncover the hidden functional potential of microbes within this harsh environment. This line of inquiry holds promise for unraveling novel metabolic pathways and natural products, offering valuable insights into their ecophysiological roles and potential applications in soil remediation. Before coming to UP Diliman, I worked with marine natural products extracted from jellyfish-associated fungi under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Daile Meek Salvador-Membreve from Bicol University where I also received my B.S. in Biology degree <i>cum laude</i>.

In addition to working on microbial systems, I also take interest in climate science studies. Previously, I co-authored an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03208-8" target="_blank">article</a> on characterizing climate vulnerability hotspots in the Bicol River Basin (BRB), an important agro-watershed system in the Bicol Region of the Philippines. Additionally, we also published an accompanying <a href="https://rhregalado.github.io/publication/bicol-river-basin-project" target="_blank">monograph</a> on establishing comprehensive early warning systems for agri-fishery communities in the BRB to help mitigate climate-related economic losses. The significance of this monograph lies in its potential to revolutionize disaster preparedness and response strategies in the vulnerable agri-fishery communities of the BRB. The significance of this publication lies in its well-rounded content, which has earned it numerous prestigious accolades in the country. These recognitions have been instrumental in amplifying the voices of marginalized Filipino climate survivors, especially during a time when people around the world are demanding for aggressive climate action.

To that end, I’ve curated this page to put together all the things that I wrote over the years as a <a style="color: steelblue" style="text-decoration:none">#ProudPinoy<a/> scholar-researcher. I hope that by sharing this platform, it will encourage interest among readers from diverse backgrounds and serve as a valuable open-access resource to stimulate thought and discussion.<br>
