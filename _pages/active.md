<h2>[Research Article] Electrokinetic in situ leaching of mine tailings with citric acid extracts copper and restructures the microbiome in a microcosm</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract:</b> Rising copper (Cu) demand and a growing inventory of Cu-bearing mine wastes highlight their potential as alternative resources, though extraction remains challenging. Electrokinetic in situ leaching (EK-ISL) offers a non-invasive alternative but its biofunctional consequence on post-treated material remains unknown. Here, we examine the potential impact of citric acid-aided (0.5 M) EK-ISL on community-wide microbiome response under laboratory conditions through 16S rRNA metabarcoding. Citrate-driven chemical gradients under electrokinetically-induced conditions resulted in efficient Cu leaching but altered soil bacterial ecology, favoring copiotrophic (Proteobacteria/Firmicutes) over oligotrophic (Chloroflexi) taxa. Functional predictions suggested an adaptive shift supporting copiotrophic traits linked to rapid growth and niche colonization. Despite microbiome restructuring, our findings argue in favor of citrate as a soil amendment, rather than a harmful contaminant by allowing key pedogenic functions like nitrogen fixation to persist. These findings highlight citrate’s potential to balance efficient metal extraction with ecological recovery.</div>
