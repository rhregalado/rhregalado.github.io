<p>I figured I’d do something different for today’s essay.</p>

<p>I love poetry. I always find a kind of therapeutic value to it, whether reading it or writing one, it feels like a warm bowl of chicken soup for the soul. This time, I want this space to breathe with fewer of my words and more of someone else’s. I want this also to empower you. I want to make it as if you’re hearing your own voice in the lines, not mine.</p>

<p>There can be that intimidation with poetry that many seem to look at it as something too complex and rather intellectual. But good poems need not to be elaborate, nor contain fireworks and bubbles, or need to rhyme to make it edible—it only needs to go the heart. But all the same, it can be quite daunting for most, but you might want to try it in small doses. If you’re just starting out learning, then perhaps learn something that doesn’t take a lot of concentration. And I think I just have the right prescriptions for you.</p>

<p>The beauty of a poetry is that it can be short. It can take only a second and still land with the same impact, if not more. Let’s begin with this poem. I’ve chosen it because it’s very short and you can learn it easily. It’s called <i>“Two Cures for Love”</i> by Wendy Cope:</p>

<blockquote style="color:var(--global-text-color-light); font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">
  1. Don’t see him. Don’t phone or write a letter.<br> 
  2. The easy way: get to know him better.<br>

<p>Wasn’t that nice? Such an antidote. Here’s another one:</p>

<blockquote style="color:var(--global-text-color-light); font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">
  When I am sad and weary,<br>
  When I think all hope has gone,<br>
  When I walk along High Holborn<br>
  I think of you with nothing on.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>This is Adrian Mitchell’s most famous love poem written for his second wife, actress Celia Hewitt. And he did well to say <i>l love you</i> this way!</p>

<p>I can’t quite remember the very first poem I ever learned, so I thought I’d share one that I love instead. What I like about it is that it’s sweet, charming, and wonderfully grounding. There’s also a lovely reading of it by one of my favorite actors, <strong>Helena Bonham Carter</strong>, which I would warmly recommend reading it alongside her. Here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcrm3JgOgD4" target="_blank">link</a> to the recording.</p>

<blockquote style="color:var(--global-text-color-light); font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">
  I’ve been thinking about the way, when you walk down<br>
  a crowded aisle, people pull in their legs<br>
  to let you by. Or how strangers still say “bless you”<br>
  when someone sneezes, a leftover<br>
  from the Bubonic plague. “Don’t die,” we are saying.<br><br>

  And sometimes, when you spill lemons<br>
  from your grocery bag, someone else will help you<br>
  pick them up. Mostly, we don’t want to harm each other.<br><br>

  We want to be handed our cup of coffee hot,<br>
  and to say thank you to the person handing it. To smile<br>
  at them and for them to smile back. For the waitress<br>
  to call us honey when she sets down the bowl of clam chowder,<br>
  and for the driver in the red pick-up truck to let us pass.<br><br>

  We have so little of each other, now. So far<br>
  from tribe and fire. Only these brief moments of exchange.<br>
  What if they are the true dwelling of the holy, these<br>
  fleeting temples we make together when we say,<br>
  “Here, have my seat,” “Go ahead—you first,” “I like your hat.”<br>

<p>If you’ve noticed, poetry just puts a sort of order in the mind. There’s something to it like calming the brain, like Mozart does it with his music. It calms the mind particularly, the violence. As you read, the strong, sane voice of the poem is often enough to silence the destructive, obsessive voices in your head.</p>

<p>It’s between the sound and saying it. You have to say it out loud for it have full benefit. So, whether it’s in your bed, in your car, or in front of your bathroom mirror, I hope you have a safe space to say it out loud. Try it this time with this one:</p>

<blockquote style="color:var(--global-text-color-light); font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">
  STRANGER! if you, passing, meet me, and desire to speak to me,<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">
    why should you not speak to me?
  </span><br>
  And why should I not speak to you?<br>

<p>For many readers, the expectation to “understand” poetry gets in the way of having the chance to enjoy it. But it in truth, poetry doesn’t demand comprehension on the first read. I love how <strong><a href="https://forwardartsfoundation.org/team/william-sieghart-cbe/" target="_blank">Sir William Sieghart</a></strong> suggests we <i>“Read a poem like a prayer. Don’t read it like fiction or journalism. And read it five nights running, you’ll get something completely different from it every time.”</i> In other words, it’s the repetition that brings the clarity. Read it in different moods, play with its different energies, go outside the box. And along its cadence, its lyricism, and musicality, you’ll see that it will always unlayer itself and offer something new that will enrich your understanding even more. Now, take a moment. Try it with this one:</p>

  Folks, I’m telling you,<br>
  birthing is hard<br> 
  and dying is mean—<br> 
  so get yourself<br> 
  a little loving<br> 
  in between.<br>

<p>In retrospect, the world can take so much from us. But a poem, once it gets inside of you, it belongs to you completely. If I were to define poetry, I’d say it is a gentle act of a poet carving out a piece of their soul onto the page, leaving it there to live forever. That’s why a poem written 700 years ago can still reach to us and unravel our souls. So, here’s an assignment for you: learn at least one poetry by heart, so it can visit you anytime you need it.</p><br>

<p>Here are other poems that I picked up along the way. I hope these inspire you to read more poetry and warm you inside like a bowl of chicken soup. Do you have a favorite poem you'd like to share? I’d love to hear about it. Send it my way through <a href="mailto:rhregalado@up.edu.ph" target="_blank">email</a>, and it just might find a home in the next blog!</p><br>

I know a place where the sun is like gold,<br>
   <span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">
     And the cherry blooms burst with snow,</span><br>
And down underneath is the loveliest nook,<br>
   <span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">
     Where the four-leaf clovers grow.</span><br><br>

One leaf is for hope, and one is for faith,<br>
   <span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">
     And one is for love, you know,</span><br>
And God put another in for luck—<br>
   <span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">
     If you search, you will find where they grow.</span><br><br>

But you must have hope, and you must have faith,<br>
   <span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">
      You must love and be strong—and so—</span><br>
If you work, if you wait, you will find the place<br>
   <span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">
     Where the four-leaf clovers grow.</span><br>

  Which answers letters; which knows the way<br>
