<p>I figured I’d do something different for today’s essay.</p>

<p>I love poetry. I always find a kind of therapeutic value to it, whether reading it or writing one, it feels like a warm bowl of chicken soup for the soul. This time, I want this space to breathe with fewer of my words and more of someone else’s. I want this also to empower you. I want to make it as if you’re hearing your own voice in the lines, not mine.</p>

<p>There can be that intimidation with poetry that many seem to look at it as something too complex and rather intellectual. But good poems need not to be elaborate, nor contain fireworks and bubbles, or need to rhyme to make it edible—it only needs to go the heart. But all the same, it can be quite daunting for most, but you might want to try it in small doses. If you’re just starting out learning, then perhaps learn something that doesn’t take a lot of concentration. And I think I just have the right prescriptions for you.</p>

<p>The beauty of a poetry is that it can be short. It can take only a second and still land with the same impact, if not more. Let’s begin with this poem. I’ve chosen it because it’s very short and you can learn it easily. It’s called <i>“Two Cures for Love”</i> by Wendy Cope:</p>

  1. Don’t see him. Don’t phone or write a letter.<br> 
  2. The easy way: get to know him better.<br>

<p>Wasn’t that nice? Such an antidote. Here’s another one:</p>

<blockquote style="color:var(--global-text-color-light); font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">
  When I am sad and weary,<br>
  When I think all hope has gone,<br>
  When I walk along High Holborn<br>
  I think of you with nothing on<br>

<p>I can’t quite remember the very first poem I ever learned, so I thought I’d share one that I love instead. What I like about it is that it’s sweet, charming, and wonderfully grounding. There’s also a lovely reading of it by one of my favorite actors, Helena Bonham Carter, which I would warmly recommend reading it alongside her. Here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcrm3JgOgD4" target="_blank">link</a> to the recording.</p>

<blockquote style="color:var(--global-text-color-light); font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">
  I’ve been thinking about the way, when you walk<br>
  down a crowded aisle, people pull in their legs<br>
  to let you by. Or how strangers still say “bless you”<br>
  when someone sneezes, a leftover<br>
  from the Bubonic plague. “Don’t die,” we are saying.<br><br>

  And sometimes, when you spill lemons<br>
  from your grocery bag, someone else will help you<br>
  pick them up. Mostly, we don’t want to harm each other.<br><br>

  We want to be handed our cup of coffee hot,<br>
  and to say thank you to the person handing it. To smile<br>
  at them and for them to smile back. For the waitress<br>
  to call us honey when she sets down the bowl of clam chowder,<br>
  and for the driver in the red pick-up truck to let us pass.<br><br>

  We have so little of each other, now. So far<br>
  from tribe and fire. Only these brief moments of exchange.<br>
  What if they are the true dwelling of the holy, these<br>
  fleeting temples we make together when we say, “Here,<br>
  have my seat,” “Go ahead — you first,” “I like your hat.”<br>
