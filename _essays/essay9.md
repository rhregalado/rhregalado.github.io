<p>I figured I’d do something different for today’s essay.</p>

<p>I love poetry. I always find a kind of therapeutic value to it, whether reading it or writing one, it feels like a warm bowl of chicken soup for the soul. This time, I want this space to breathe with fewer of my words and more of someone else’s. I want this also to empower you. I want to make it as if you’re hearing your own voice in the lines, not mine.</p>

<p>There can be that intimidation with poetry that many seem to look at it as something too complex and rather intellectual. But good poems need not to be elaborate, nor contain fireworks and bubbles, or need to rhyme to make it edible—it only needs to go the heart. But all the same, it can be quite daunting for most, but you might want to try it in small doses. If you’re just starting out learning, then perhaps learn something that doesn’t take a lot of concentration. And I think I just have the right prescriptions for you.</p>

<p>The beauty of a poetry is that it can be short. It can take only a second and still land with the same impact, if not more. Let’s begin with this poem. I’ve chosen it because it’s very short and you can learn it easily. It’s called <i>“Two Cures for Love”</i> by Wendy Cope:</p>

<blockquote style="color:var(--global-text-color-light); font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;"> 
  1. Don’t see him. Don’t phone or write a letter.<br> 
  2. The easy way: get to know him better.<br>

    <em>Two Cures for Love</em>, Wendy Cope </cite> 
</blockquote>

<p>Wasn’t that nice? Such an antidote. Here’s another one:</p>

<blockquote style="color:var(--global-text-color-light); font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">
  When I am sad and weary,<br>
  When I think all hope has gone,<br>
  When I walk along High Holborn<br>
  I think of you with nothing on<br>
