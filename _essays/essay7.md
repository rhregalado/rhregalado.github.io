<div style="text-align: justify;">

<p>It was the second semester of my junior-year in 2016 when, for the first time, I found myself separated from my four closest college barkada for a major group project in BIO19 (Animal Physio). For three full years, we had moved as one unit. Being together was the default. We chose the same classes when we could, sat in familiar clusters during lectures, and navigate every group works side-by-side. Together, we thrived on shared chaos, inside jokes, and haphazard teamwork that somehow worked despite the odds.</p>

<p>This time, though, the universe—disguised as our favorite professor, Ma’am Jazz—had other plans in what seemed to be a clean, fair, strategic classroom shuffle. She would be the architect of the groupings, not us. She announced it with a gentle firmness that left no room for negotiation, no space for bargaining, no hint of mercy. So, when the groupings were revealed and our names landed elsewhere, the separation felt… mildly unsettling. This plot twist didn’t just rattle our own little circle, it also sent seismic events throughout every tight-knit friendships in class. All friend groups would be scattered. Comfort zones would be shaken loose.</p>

<p>Her logic for this breakup was crisp and strangely logical: we’d grown a little too dependent, a little too sequestered on our own exclusive circles. Even the top scorers in class had clustered together, creating little fortresses of talent. It was high time, she said, that the “powerhouses” are scattered among the class and redistribute the talent. It was perhaps a classroom revolution that, in its own wild unexpected way, changed how we all understood friendship… forever.</p>

<p>This wasn’t the usual “meet twice and submit” kind of group work. This demanded constant check-ins with our experiments, which meant seeing each other five or six days a week for the rest of the semester (i.e., even at night). Yet, in hindsight, it turned out far better than we imagined. Those long hours in the lab became fertile ground for new bonds to grow. Inch by inch, conversations sprouted, fondness took root, and fresh unexpected friendships soon began to bloom.</p>

<p>By the time we wrapped up the project and returned back to our original circles, an unexpected feeling settled in each of us—yearning? Yearning for the bonds we had, and the ones still waiting to grow. Those small, individual seeds of yearning eventually pulled us all in the same direction. So, we did the most sensible thing: come together to form a (much) bigger circle. Imagine scattered sprigs of flowers arranging themselves into one massive joyful bouquet. And on a fateful day in March 2017, as we capped our junior-year journey during a Recognition Program, that friendship found its name: <strong>Whiteflower</strong>.</p>

    <i>The beginnings of Whiteflower</i><br>
    College of Science Recognition Program, March 2017.
  </figcaption>
  <br>

<p>The name “Whiteflower” was likely a playful nod to <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7284466/" target="_blank">Wildflower</a></i>, a primetime TV hit of the time known for its dramatic twists, exaggerated over-the-top storylines, and occasional side plots so ridiculous they became instant memes. True enough, it was a name that captured just the right mix of flair, chaos, and charm—much like our newly bloomed friendship itself.</p>

<p>And so, from that one wild twist of fate, worlds gently collided. From three separate circles, here we are—nearly a decade on—an inseparable, wildly insufferable bunch! And what began as fewer than fifteen back in March 2017 quietly grew into more than twenty now, like a garden left joyfully untamed, budding year after year as new faces settled in: some grafted in by love, others wandered close and were welcomed as honorary blooms. The once small garden became something fuller, wilder, and unmistakably alive. Somewhere along the way, we found ourselves present for nearly every proper adult milestone in each other’s lives; most if not all had attended four weddings, a christening, and even… a funeral.</p><br>

<p>This space is for our dearest, most cherished Francis Abuid, or Abs, as we’d lovingly call him. It has been four years now, soon five on January 10th, since a vehicular accident took him in 2021. I/we celebrate his life as someone who looks at the world as unapologetically his. He lived his life as a wildlife and conservation biologist in the truest and selfless sense of the word. Renowned, but more than that; purposeful. He believed that caring for all wildlife was his glorious purpose. He was gentle, and he was fierce. He was a fighter, and a trailblazer. He was unstoppable. No tribute ever feels enough, but this much is certain: he was the truest friend anyone could have, right until the end. He cared so deeply, loved so intensely, and worried so thoughtfully. He was the best of us. And we miss him every day.</p>

<p>I know I speak for all of us when I say how immeasurably lucky we are to have been touched by Abs, to have had him plant seeds of love that we still carry and share. He was our whitest Whiteflower; both figuratively and, quite literally, so.</p>

<p>Just a year after his passing, a new plant species was named after him: <i>Begonia francisabuidii</i>. The lead author of the publication<sup>1,2</sup> said that the white flowers that bloomed from the <i>B. francisabuidii</i> species were as pure as the heart and dedication of Abs to inspire young learners to guard and conserve the biodiversity of the region. <i>Begonia francisabuidii</i> is endemic to Albay, and proposed as Critically Endangered; a fragile beauty, held so close to home.</p>

<b>The bloom of <i>Begonia francisabuidii</i>, showing both its staminate (male) and pistillate (female) flowers.</b> It has four white petal-like parts (tepals): the outer two are broad, while the inner two are smaller, rounded, and smooth. The male parts include numerous yellow stamens with tiny pollen sacs, while the female part has a small, three-sided ovary.

  <br>

<p>And so, <i>“Whiteflower,”</i> is more than just a silly wordplay now to call our group. It carries meaning now, and memory, and pride. I’m certain Abs would be so proud of us if he could see us now, slowly unfolding into who we are each becoming.</p><br>

<p>Fast forward today, having the opportunity to sit down together, listen to my friends talk, laugh, ramble, and reflect, I found myself thoroughly in awe. We all stepped into young adulthood carrying different fears, hopes, and timelines, yet each of us found our own footing and the way forward. Some paths were loud and bold, others gentle and winding, but all of them took courage. There were detours, pauses, wrong turns, and moments when we doubted ourselves, but there was also growth: real, hard-earned growth. I’ve actually went my way and took some notes of their wins this year to flex them to all of you reading this. This would be quite a long read, so please bear with me:</p>

<p>I realized, softly and all at once, how deeply rewarding this year has been for each of us. 2025 felt like a year of quiet wins and gentle celebrations, of growing into ourselves without too much force. It reminded us to be thankful, to pause and reflect, to be brave when we could and, most of all, to simply be who we are. If these reunions had any purpose, it was to show us that the people we were about ten years ago are here to stay: just as chaotic, just as unabashed, only now a little more candid, happier, braver, and far freer. Being together again made it clear that we are each other’s refuge. In one another’s company, we build quiet safe spaces where everyone is allowed to exist as they are, to feel at home in their own skin, and to live their truth.</p>

<p>But isn’t it a little demanding to keep friendships afloat these days? Let alone twenty of them at once?!</p> 

<p>In some ways, yes. Some friendships do need constant tending, the kind that asks for regular care, attention, and time, like plants that need frequent watering to grow. Distance, of course, makes this even harder. But our friendship has always been different. We were never strangers to distance; in fact, it was where we began. Remember? Maybe that’s why our roots grew deeper than most: deep enough to find their own water, even when we’re far apart. Our friendship is self-sustaining, I might argue, held together by bonds you can’t see but can always feel, no matter the distance. And it shows. After a decade of friendship, it still feels just the same, carrying the same warmth and ease it always has.</p>

<p>There is a quiet strength in platonic love. It has made me realize that this kind of love is not secondary to romantic love, but essential in its own right. Romantic partnerships are often placed on a pedestal, yet love flows through many other channels, just as meaningful and just as sustaining. So much is lost when we fail to recognize and lean into these other forms of love. Perhaps this is why it feels so astonishing how, despite our full and demanding lives, as doctors, teachers, wives, mothers, and young professionals finding our way, we still continue to show up for one another’s most important chapters. That consistency and effort says everything about how deeply this friendship is valued… No, no longer just friendship. Family. This is family now. We are a family.</p>

<p>And so, as we close another year together, as a family, we look ahead with hopeful hearts praying for abundance, for strength, and for a garden that remains full, alive, and always in bloom, season after season.</p>

<p>Happy New Year, everyone!</p>
