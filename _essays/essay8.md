<p>Let me pose a question: is the ability to ask questions considered a skill? And if so, does true skill lie in asking the right ones?</p>

<p>It wasn’t until I reach my post-grad studies that I realized that the true test of learning is not in what you can remember or memorize, but in the questions you are able to ask about it.</p>

<p>This is based from experience. In school, our teachers would unfailingly ask at the end of each lesson, <i>“Do you have any questions?” </i> Yet, like most students, we would almost always answer, <i> “None.” </i> It is as if we were guided more by convenience than curiosity, maybe eager for the recess or simply in the idea of freedom. Looking back, it becomes clear that this simple ritual, so often dismissed, was more than just a perfunctory check but more of a lesson in the art of inquiry and learning.</p>

<p>In one of my Master’s classes, during journal club sessions, we were tasked with evaluating the day’s reporter. On our rating sheets, we also had to write down two (2) “thought-provoking questions” from the report we had just discussed. On the surface, asking a question should have been easy. A walk in the park. Yet more often than not, I found myself among the last to leave the room, struggling to write even a single question! Don’t get me wrong: I could confidently say that I understood the discussion and grasped its main points. But when pressed to distill that understanding into a thoughtful question, I realized how little I had truly reflected on the material. At the time, I hadn’t even recognized that asking thoughtful, intentional questions was a skill I also needed to hone. It was humbling and I’m still working on it. A stark reminder that comprehension and curiosity are not the same, and that true learning often begins with the questions we dare to ask.</p><br>

<p>Perhaps the same is true of love.</p>
<p>Do you ask your love ones questions? Do you ask the right ones? More importantly, are you genuinely curious?</p><br>

<p>I want to offer a simple thesis: <strong>curiosity is the smallest unit of meaning from which all expressions of love are formed.</strong></p>

<p>Let's try to dissect it. At its most fundamental level, love is structured around a single core: curiosity, from which all the love languages emanate. Curiosity is seen in noticing the needs and responding with care (acts of service); in discovering what brings meaning or value to something (gifts); in attuning to and responding to another’s physical or emotional state (physical touch); in exploring shared experiences (quality time); and in carefully choosing words that convey care and warmth (words of affirmation). And so, seen this way, talking, dates, and gifts are not the substance of love itself, but the rituals through which curiosity is expressed and made tangible.</p>

<p>To be curious, from this perspective, is to desire to truly see someone and understand their inner world. It is like assembling a mosaic of who they are from the fragments they offer. That’s where true intimacy thrives. Curiosity <i>is</i> intimacy. Without it, surface questions are just collected facts, like reading a wiki page on your favorite pop star.</p> 

<p>Trying to know someone is absolutely a deep type of helping someone be seen. I didn’t realize how much I needed someone to ask why I felt, thought, or liked something—until someone finally did. Now, that is exactly what I want to do with others (and even in my work). I want to understand their perspectives, learn from them, but, more importantly, make space for them to be the versions of themselves they love and let it be received.</p>

<p>That is why <i>knowing</i> is a form of loving, and to be <i>known</i> is to be truly loved.</p>
<p>As budding scientists, we are being trained to be unrelentingly curious. But that same insight carries over into love. Knowing facts about someone is easy, but intimacy begins with the willingness to ask, to truly listen, and to be shaped by what is revealed. Just as science deepens through inquiry, love grows through the questions we dare to ask and the care with which we receive the answers.</p>

<p>As a parting thought, here’s a small piece of trivia: the root word for <i>curiosity</i> comes from the Latin <i>cura,</i> meaning <i>care.</i></p>

<p>So, stay curious.</p>
