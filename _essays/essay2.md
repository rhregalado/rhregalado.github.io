excerpt: '<b>[POEM]</b> Sharing this four-part poem I wrote years ago after visiting a place so vivid and pure it stole my heart in an instant. One moment I was simply gazing at a mountain peak, breathing in the stillness, and the next, my hands were furiously scribbling words I didn’t even know I had in me.

<div style="text-align: justify;">Sharing this four-part poem I wrote years ago after visiting a place so vivid and pure it stole my heart in an instant. One moment I was simply gazing at a mountain peak, breathing in the stillness, and the next, my hands were furiously scribbling words I didn’t even know I had in me. I stared at them for a long while before it hit me—that I think I’d made poetry. I tucked it away and forgot about it. But now there’s this person, and as I read it again, I can’t help but wonder; maybe it was for him all along...</div>

<h2>Part 1: Encounters and Longings</h2>

I once visited a place of awe and wonder,<br> 
The scent of fresh bloomed flowers permeated the air.<br>
A place so strange yet so familiar,<br>
It brings that quintessential feeling of nostalgia and adventure.<br>
Beneath the damp canopy speckled with delicate yet vibrant <i>Rafflesia</i>,<br>
I fell in love with a pleasant <i>je ne sais quoi</i>.<br>
As I wandered deeper beneath the windswept trees,<br>
A gentle gust of wind tickled my knees.<br>
A moment of curiosity, I looked behind,<br>
A lady in simple white dress, a vision so divine.<br>

<h2>Part 2: To the Tenth Muse in White</h2>
She smelled like delicate sampaguitas in summer,<br>
Her smile as sweet as nectar.<br>
She has a doe's soft eyes and a refined carriage,<br>
With a polished air of delicacy and resilient nobility.<br>
I asked her if she was lost and alone,<br>
She smiled, nodding gently with her floral crown.<br>
She finally spoke and asked me the same,<br>
And as I answered, I sought to learn her name.<br>

<h2>Part 3: Of Blooms and Wistful Departures</h2>
Hesitant, she put her hand instead along my chest,<br>
Inhaling deeply, she bid my heart to rest.<br> 
"Trust your feelings will unfurl, let them find their way,<br>
I'll ensure they're heard, come what may."<br>
With a parting gift, a yellow bloom to keep,<br>
"If you'll be looking for me, know I'll be in sleep."<br>
And with a farewell as mysterious as her guise,<br>
She departed, leaving me to surmise.<br>

<h2>Part 4: <i>Was beßer ist reden oder sterben?</i></h2>
<h5>(German; is it better to speak or to die?)</h5>
A thousand words I wish to share with you,<br>
But none of these are what you need right now.<br>
I confided them to her, in fervent hopes she'll find you,<br>
For now, know that I'm here; patient, caring and true.<br><br>
