<p><em>“Presumed straight until proven otherwise.”</em> Or,</p>
<p><em>“Heterosexual until proven guilty.”</em></p>
<p>Has to be the most unkind, unnecessary, unsolicited remark I’ve ever heard to be thrown in casual conversations; as if sexuality in itself is inherently incriminating.</p>

<p>I think there is something intrinsically perverse on how others conveniently perceive heterosexuality as the only “natural” expression of being, as if it were the unquestioned baseline in the life history of any individual. The reason it’s taken as the default is probably simple: most of the population happens to be "straight," that's why straight is the default sexuality. It's a statistically accurate assumption. However, this thinking doesn’t really clarify anything; if anything, it only creates distance—reducing the human experience to a mere numerical imagination. It is polarizing as it is dismissive, and shrinks the full range of human (or even biological) experience.</p>

<p>This could be news to some: same-sex behavior, or 'homosexuality,' has been observed and documented in over 1,500 species<sup>1,2</sup> across the animal kingdom (this figure still likely underestimates the true prevalence due to underreporting). This includes diverse invertebrate groups, such as insects, spiders, mollusks, nematodes, as well as in all major vertebrate clades including fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. It is particularly prevalent in nonhuman primates<sup>3</sup>, where it has been observed in at least 51 species from lemurs to apes<sup>4</sup>. The variety and ubiquity of same-sex sexual behavior in animals is impressive; there are many thousands of instances of same-sex courtship, pair bonding, and copulation<sup>5</sup>. Yet, animals are no stranger to the discrimination. In many ways, animal homosexuality described in books closely parallels the reality of human homosexuality in society at large.</p>

<p>In what perhaps a riveting account of Bruce Bagemihl in his landmark book <strong><em>Biological Exuberance</em></strong> (1999)<sup>6</sup>, he vividly illustrated and painstakingly documented the spectrum of animal behavior, while he lamented that:</p>

<blockquote>
“Homosexuality in both animals and people has been considered, at various times, to be a pathological condition; a social aberration; an ‘immoral,’ ‘sinful,’ or ‘criminal’ perversion; an artificial product of confinement or the unavailability of the opposite sex; a reversal or ‘inversion’ of heterosexual ‘roles’; a ‘phase’ that younger animals go through on the path to heterosexuality; an imperfect imitation of heterosexuality; an exceptional but unimportant activity; a useless and puzzling curiosity; and a functional behavior that ‘stimulates’ or ‘contributes to’ heterosexuality. In many other respects, however, the outright hostility toward animal homosexuality has transcended all historical trends. One need only look at the litany of derogatory terms […] words such as <strong>strange, bizarre, perverse, aberrant, deviant, abnormal, anomalous,</strong> and <strong>unnatural</strong> have all been used routinely in ‘objective’ scientific descriptions of the phenomenon […]. In addition, heterosexual behavior is consistently defined in numerous scientific accounts as ‘normal’ in contrast to homosexual activity.”
</blockquote>

<p>In one of its book chapters<sup>7</sup>, Bagemihl richly recounted how pervasive these biases were, even in respected scholarly publications and scientific discourse. He provided carefully curated examples of animal homosexuality from across the literature, some of them narrated as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Courtship and mounting between male lions were labeled an “atypical sexual fixation.”<sup>8</sup></li>
  <li>Rhesus macaques (a species of monkey) were said to react with “homosexual panic” to same-sex advances, reflecting misconceptions about human homosexuality<sup>9</sup>.</li>
  <li>In Greenshanks (a species of bird), heterosexual copulations were described in florid, sympathetic language, one episode was called a “lovely act of mating” and “a poem of ecstasy and delight;” while homosexual copulations were given cursory descriptions or even labeled “bizarre affairs.”<sup>10,11</sup></li>
  <li>Sexual activity between female gorillas, which generally lasts longer than heterosexual copulations, was speculatively attributed to “mechanical difficulties,” ignoring the possibility that females might experience closer bonding or greater enjoyment with each other; as reflected by their face-to-face position and other features also seen in heterosexual activities<sup>12</sup>.</li>
  <li>In studies of black-headed gulls (a species of bird), the term “monogamous” (implying stability) was reserved for heterosexual pairs, even though homosexual pairs can also be stable and monogamous, albeit heterosexual pairs being nonmonogamous sometimes<sup>13</sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you see, many scientists felt compelled to attach or embellish all sorts of value-laden labels to same-sex behavior, as if their contempt weren’t derogatory enough. My main point is this, same-sex behavior has been observed in over a thousand species. <strong>Homophobia has only been observed in one:</strong> humans.</p>

<p>If it’s not yet obvious from the examples above, homosexuality irrevocably co-exists with heterosexuality in nature. By that logic, homosexuality is natural. In fact, a recent parsimonious model postulated that species expressing both homosexual and heterosexual behaviors will turn out to be more common than species with exclusive heterosexual behaviors, which may be a rarity in nature<sup>1</sup>. In other words, an all-heterosexual population—whether it be in humans or lower-order animals—will be difficult to encounter in nature. Ergo, homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality. That is the reality. Numerous studies support it. Others might categorically deny it, but denying reality is called being delusional.</p>

<p>Many conservatives will now have to argue:</p>
<em><p>So, we’re now comparing humans to wild animals?;</p>
<p>If we’re talking about comparisons to animal behavior, does that mean humans should also be doing incest, infanticide, or cannibalism?;</p>
<p>This confuses biological observations with sociocultural phenomena and anthropomorphizes animal behavior;</p>
<p>Animals have no sense of morality;</p>
<p>Appeal to nature fallacy.</p></em>

<p>These arguments, I would say, are no less meant to derail the discussion by lumping together completely different unrelated categories. Raising such points distracts from the main issue: the claim that <strong>homosexuality is “unnatural.”</strong> If something is deemed ‘wrong’ solely because it is “unnatural,” then evidence showing that it occurs widely in nature directly invalidates that claim. Behaviors like incest, infanticide, or cannibalism in animals are survival strategies shaped by ecological pressures. They cannot be used to draw moral parallels with human society because humans evaluate actions through ethics, law, and social norms, not instinct. It is worth noting that appeals to a Higher Power are also irrelevant in this context. It is important to keep this discussion grounded in evidence, rather than theology. Remember, the concept of God is only found in one species, and it just so happens to be the only one where homophobia also happens. If one argues that God condones hatred, it only underscores that such notions, like homophobia itself, are human constructs rather than universal truths.</p>

<p>Here, my point in citing animal homosexuality is to underscore its biological normality, not to offer moral endorsements.</p><br>

<p>It is an unassailable fact that male-female pairing (heterosexuality) is the primary engine for speciation, genetic diversity, and long-term evolutionary change; for the main reason that it facilitates the mixing of genes and creation of new combinations for natural selection to act on. In higher-order organisms, it fulfills the most fundamental biological need: producing offspring to ensure the perpetuation of the species and the stability of the gene pool. Basic Biology 101. Therefore, individuals with fertilization-compatible gametes, described as 'heterosexuality,' are broadly understood in biological terms as fulfilling a function tied to survival and reproduction.</p>

<p>You might then ask: so, where does homosexuality fit in the grand “order of things?” You see, although it runs counter to biology’s primal mandate, it has nonetheless persisted and maintained throughout animal evolution in several independent disparate lineages across the tree of life. Why would animals engage in sexual behaviors that do not directly produce offspring and could, in theory, reduce individual fitness—or even risk extinction if universally adopted?<sup>1</sup> Perhaps the answer is, in fact, quite simple: same-sex behavior provides ecological or social advantages that support survival in ways other than reproduction. Its persistence suggests that it plays roles beneficial enough to be maintained across multispecies and across evolutionary time.</p>

<p>As same-sex behavior becomes documented more widely in the wild, many scientists working in disparate areas, from sociology and psychology to behavioural and evolutionary biology are devoting greater attention to addressing what they consider an evolutionary conundrum or ‘Darwinian paradox.’ Here are just some examples where we see how homosexuality supports the survival of a species, revealing a rich and complex facet of biology in all its exuberance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bottlenose dolphins exhibit some of the highest rates of same-sex sexual behavior observed in any animal. Male-male mounting, genital contact, and “goosing” appear to strengthen alliances within male groups<sup>14</sup>.</li>
  <li>Hawaiian albatross colonies report that 31% of all pairs consist of female-female bonds. These pair-bonded females court, preen each other, and share parenting duties. Although they raise fewer chicks than male-female pairs, they do better than unpaired females, demonstrating the adaptive value of cooperative social bonds<sup>15</sup>.</li>
  <li>In bison and musk ox, homosexual behavior was mostly reciprocal and occurred outside the breeding season, helping males form bachelor groups, thereby reducing aggression, and reinforce dominance hierarchies<sup>16</sup>.</li>
  <li>Nonhuman primates provide perhaps the clearest link between same-sex behavior and social survival. In species where the killing of conspecific adults, or adulticide, is a risk, same-sex sexual behavior has evolved to divert and mitigate aggression, facilitate bonding, form alliances, stabilize groups, and aid post-conflict reconciliation, ultimately supporting group cohesion<sup>2</sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is entirely theoretically possible, though, that all 1,500 of those animal species are profoundly homophobic, we just don’t have the means to interpret them as homophobia. Or, more likely, they simply don’t care. We humans just love our labels. Sometimes a lioness is just a lioness… no other identities required, no affirmations needed. And, yes, we do have many ways now to observe animal social interaction <em>in natura</em>, and it’s clear that homosexuality is not seen as unusual by animals.</p>

<p>As you can see, love is found in every species. Hate is not. Homosexuality has always been here forever as part of life, whereas homophobia is a very much recent concept, with absolutely no biological basis nor evolutionary advantage. And this applies equally to racism, misogyny, mass violence, or genocide. And until humans recognize and reflect on this, we will continue to see modern <em>Homo sapiens</em> with a stone age psychology operating on paleolithic emotions and medieval mindsets.</p>

<p>So, the next time you hear the old chestnut, “straight until proven otherwise,” a perfectly good comeback might be: “gay until proven straight.” And remember the exuberance in this anthem: <em>“I’m beautiful in my way, ’cause God makes no mistakes. I’m on the right track, baby I was born this way.”</em></p>
