excerpt: '<b>[SCHOLARLY ESSAY]</b> A seemingly contradictory phenomenon of the simultaneous prevalence of obesity and poverty in our population has taken hold across the world. Statistically, 2017 was reported to be the first year in a decade to record an alarming rise in the number of hungry people, according to the United Nations. Along with the rise in hunger, there has also been a continued aggressive rise in obesity. On the surface, this seems to be a highly unusual global phenomenon – an increase in global hunger with a simultaneous increase in global obesity. However, what is remarkable and counterintuitive is that the contradictory concepts between obesity and poverty can actually coexist within the same individual, family, or community – and practically a reality that is difficult to disentangle. Thus, it begs the question: <i>how come we are both?</i>'
